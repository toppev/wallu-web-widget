That's it! Your Discord AI is now available on your website. 🎉

### 🎮 Try the Live Demo First!

**Experience your future Discord-powered website support:**

1. Open `demo.html` in your browser (or visit our demo site)
2. Chat with the AI - it's the same one helping Discord communities
3. See how it would look on your website
4. Then download `wallu-widget.js` and set up your own!

### 🔑 Get Your API Key

1. Visit [Wallu Panel - Addons](https://panel.wallubot.com/addons)
2. Create a new **public** API key (starts with `pk_`)
3. Copy your API key and use it in your chosen installation method

## ⚙️ Configuration Made Simple

### 30-second installation

```html
<script>
    // Configure your API key BEFORE loading the widget
    window.WALLU_CONFIG = {
        apiKey: 'pk_your_actual_key_here', // 🔑 REQUIRED: Get from https://panel.wallubot.com/addons
        theme: 'gaming',
    }
</script>
<script defer src="https://wallubot.com/wallu-widget.js"></script>
```

### Fully customizable (download & edit `wallu-widget.js`)

TIP: Ask AI (Claude or ChatGPT) to customize the widget!

Open `wallu-widget.js` and update the `WALLU_CONFIG` section:

```javascript
const WALLU_CONFIG = {
    // 🔑 REQUIRED: Get this from https://panel.wallubot.com/addons
    apiKey: 'pk_your_actual_key_here',

    // 🎨 THEME: Pick one that matches your brand
    theme: 'discord', // 'discord', 'corporate', 'tech', 'gaming', 'minimal'

    // 📝 OPTIONAL: Customize the experience
    botName: 'AI Assistant',
    welcomeMessage: 'Hey! I\'m here to help with the same knowledge from our Discord.',
    position: 'bottom-right', // or 'bottom-left'

    // 🔗 OPTIONAL: Log conversations to Discord
    discordWebhook: true,

    // 🔒 OPTIONAL: pin what the widget claims so you can lock this key to it (see "Restrict which
    // knowledge the widget can reach" below). Defaults to the page path + your site host.
    channelId: null, // e.g. '/website-support'
    addonName: null, // e.g. 'web-widget (mysite.com)'
};
```

### 🎛️ Advanced Configuration

**Custom Bot Instructions per Channel:**  
You can set specific instructions for your AI assistant for different parts of your website by configuring channels in
the [Wallu Panel - Channels](https://panel.wallubot.com/channels). This allows you to have different bot behavior on different pages or sections of your site.
Each request's "channel" is the page path (or your `channelId`), so per-page instructions and the key restrictions below both key off the same value.

**Examples:**

- **Homepage**: General welcome and company info
- **Support Page**: Technical troubleshooting focus
- **Sales Page**: Product-focused responses
- **Documentation**: Code examples and technical details

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Colors and Theming

```javascript
// Custom color themes
const themes = {
    blue: { primaryColor: '3b82f6' },
    green: { primaryColor: '10b981' },
    purple: { primaryColor: '8b5cf6' },
    red: { primaryColor: 'ef4444' },
    custom: { primaryColor: 'your-hex-color' }
};
```

### Messages and Content

```javascript
// Customize all text content
new WalluChatWidget({
    botName: 'Your Bot Name',
    botAvatar: 'AI', // Or emoji like '🤖'
    welcomeMessage: 'Custom welcome message here!',
    placeholderText: 'Type your question...',
    // ... other options
});
```

## 🔒 Security & API Keys

### Public vs Private Keys

- ✅ **Public keys** (`pk_*`) - Safe to use in frontend code
    - Only allow sending messages to the API (just like user messages on Discord)
    - Cannot modify bot settings
    - Perfectly fine to include in your website code

- ❌ **Private keys** - Never use in frontend
    - Allow full access to your bot settings
    - Can modify documents, settings, etc.
    - Keep these server-side only

### Restrict which knowledge the widget can reach

By default the widget can reach **all** of your Discord bot's knowledge - usually exactly what you want, the same answers on your
site as in Discord. But a public key is visible in your page source, so anyone can copy it and send a **different** `channel.id` or
`addon.name` to the API. If you keep some FAQs or documents restricted to a specific Discord channel or addon, someone could use
your key to pull those answers onto their own page too.

Each message the widget sends claims:

- `channel.id` = the current page path (e.g. `/support`), or your `channelId` if you set one
- `addon.name` = `web-widget (yourdomain.com)`, or your `addonName` if you set one

To lock the key to only what the widget actually sends, open the [Addons page](https://panel.wallubot.com/addons), edit your public
key, and set **Restrict knowledge**:

- **Allowed channels** - e.g. `/*` to allow any page on your site (this alone blocks anyone claiming a real Discord channel id)
- **Allowed addons** - e.g. `web-widget (yourdomain.com)`

`*` is a wildcard. Set **both** to fully lock a key - leaving one empty allows anything for it. Requests outside the allowed values
are rejected with `403`. To pin the widget to a **single** channel's knowledge, set `channelId`/`addonName` in the config and allow
exactly those values.

If you don't restrict any FAQs/documents per channel, you don't need to do this - there's nothing extra to unlock and the widget
just uses your general knowledge.

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

- The API has built-in rate limiting
- Consider implementing client-side rate limiting for heavy traffic sites
- Discord webhook logging helps monitor for abuse
- Public keys have limited scope to minimize abuse potential

## 📊 Discord Integration

### Webhook Logging (Optional)

Track conversations in Discord:

```javascript
new WalluChatWidget({
    // Send logs to staff notification channel configured in https://panel.wallubot.com/settings
    discordWebhook: true,
    // ... other config
});
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Widget not appearing:**

- Look for CORS issues in browser console

**Mobile display issues:**

- Test responsive design on actual devices
- Check CSS media queries
- Verify touch event handling

**Styling conflicts:**
